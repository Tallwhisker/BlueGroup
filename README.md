# Group Blue Webshop
## Lexicon IT-pÃ¥byggnadsutbildning (IT supplementary education)

This is a group project aimed at developing a prototype for an e-shop website.
It is a front-end application programmed using the React.js and Bootstrap frameworks.
The front page lists the available categories to browse, in which products can be viewed.
Each product has an assigned category, as well as brand, name, price, and quantity attributes with a thumbnail displayed for each.
The product data is stored in the JSON file with the same name in src > data from which the products are fetched.
The header and footer are displayed on each page, adorned with mostly non-functional links for demonstration purposes.
The project was undertaken in 4 days and was presented on 2024-07-12.
